FoOlFuuka
=========

### Notice: FoOlFuuka is not yet ready to be installed. 

The following is about the features that will be available when it reaches version 0.8, that by our plans will be the first version that can be used by the public.

About
-----

FoOlFuuka is an imageboard written in PHP, based on the CodeIgniter MVC framework.

The project started as an alternative to the Fuuka interface, in order to be able to implement moderation features and few optimizations to be able to take on the traffic. Over time we noticed that it would've been a successful and complete imageboard script. Now it can work both as an archive interface through Asagi, and as a normal imageboard.

This document will explain what's cool about FoOlFuuka. You will have to go to the wiki for installation instructions and other useful articles.

Requirements
------------

* PHP 5.3, __PHP 5.3.11+ suggested__
* MySQL 5.1, __MySQL 5.5+ suggested__

The heart
---------

* Theme appeal 

    You won't have to choose an imageboard script for its looks anymore, because FoOlFuuka can be any of them, with its powerful theme system, allowing you to fully customize the interface, from Yotsuba to Reddit (you know, for April Fools).

* Stress relieved

    We need FoOlFuuka to store over 100.000.000 posts without ever pruning any, while there's hundreds of people browsing them. This challenge brought us to build an optimized system that will feel light both on shared hosts and on sites as large... at least as large as ours.

* Code sparkles

    Web applications easily become huge, and one can't use improvisation when building one from scratch. That's why with PHP it's good practice to use battle-tested frameworks (like for any other language in case of webApps). CodeIgniter irons the "bad parts" of PHP, while we keep the code readable and extensible. It's coded by a team, so we care about this.

* Search unites

    Projects need connections, people need to look back to their own posts, oldfriends want to tell how times have changed. The search system keeps your old posts alive with its many options, so your community can keep track of the posts and kick butt.

* Discussions never end

    Inherited like the search system from Fuuka, we've powered up the Ghost system to work also with normal boards. Because threads are never deleted, it would be annoying to see old threads necroed. That's how old threads become ghosts, and whoever posts in them will get the thread bumped only in the Ghost index. That pun was not intended.

* Admin happy

    Never touch the configuration files. The administration panel covers everything, from board creation to archive fetcher startup. From giving you server suggestions to adding MarkDown help pages. Migrations are handled, auto-upgrades too.

* Easy to install

    Have you ever installed Wordpress, or just any PHP application? FoOlFuuka is just as easy to install. Reach our wiki for details.
